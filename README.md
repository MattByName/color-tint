# ColorTint
## NEW MAINTAINER WANTED
As much as I enjoyed getting this extension going, I'm not currently in a position to maintain it as regularly as is needed. Javascript isn't a language I know well, making it difficult for me to keep up with changes to the Gnome API. On top of that, I don't actually use GNOME myself anymore. If you're interested in taking over this project, which offers an important accessibility feature to Gnome, please drop me an email at [drmattbarnard@gmail.com](mailto:drmattbarnard@gmail.com).
## About
ColorTint is a Gnome extension that draws a translucent coloured overlay over your desktop. This is to help people with dyslexia, scopic sensitivity, and related conditions.

## Contributing
Please do contribute if you want to change something or help out with one of the issues. I'm not very familiar with JavaScript, and only made this because I needed it for myself.
