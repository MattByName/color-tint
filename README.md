# ColorTint
## About
A Gnome 3 extension for tinting the desktop with a color of your choice to help with dyslexia, scopic sensitivity, and related conditions. This is intended to replace [Gnome Tint](https://github.com/ragnarok451/gnome-tint), which no longer seems to be in active development.

## Features
* Set any colour using RGB sliders
* Custom translucency through alpha slider
* ColorTint remembers your chosen color, automatically saving it when you change it, and loading on launch
* The tint is off by default. Click the paintbrush icon and toggle "Tint" to enable.
